#Planechase Deck

This is an app that allows one to play a game of planechase without needing to own all the planechase cards.

##Goals of the App

Be intuitve to use, and run with minimal issues including being unable to download card images.

##Technology

###Firebase
I am using firebase to host the project mostly because I am already hosting other projects and because of its easy of use.

###React Native/ Expo
I was exploring the possibility of uploading the app to both Apples & Googles app stores so I went with React Native.  Debuging for apple became to much of a challange and I decided to just host the web version.

I went with Expo for creating the react native environment becuase of the promise of ease when it came to debugging on mobile devices and the ease of setting up the project.

##Problems
I do not have an apple device to test the app on and it because too difficult to test the app on mobile devices.

React Native came with its own challenges and learning curve becuase I wasn't able to use normal html elements as I was use too with other React projects.
